Hi, I'm Swap! 

I'm currently a Computer Science grad student at the University of Southern California and I like making lots of random side-projects! I'm currently interested in Android Development and making scalable applications!

Outside of coding, I'm playing games, reading books, collecting bucket hats, or ranking hot-sauces!

I'm currently into Rocket League (C2), CS:GO (I can't quit send help), and ALWAYS Kingdom Hearts!  
Apart from RL, I've been playing more single-player titles lately, like Persona 5, Xenoblade, etc. because online games are too stressful hahaha!

Current fav hot-sauce: [Zombie Apocalypse](https://www.torchbearersauces.com/product/zombie-apocalypse-bottle-5oz/)

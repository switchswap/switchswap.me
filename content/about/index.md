Hi, I'm Swap! 

I'm currently a Senior Computer Science student at the University of Southern California and I like making lots of random side-projects! I'm interested in Android Development and making scalable applications and in my free time I like to learn new programming languages.

Currently I have my eyes on Elixir and Rust but nim and zig are also on my radar.

When I'm not coding, you can catch me playing games, learning guitar, or reading!
